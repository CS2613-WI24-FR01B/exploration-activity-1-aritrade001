## Introduction
This document provides an overview of my exploration activity 1 for CS2613. This application is designed to help improve my understanding about the libraries of python and get hands-on learning experience from  the organization websites and youtube channels within the project's community. This appliaction can be improved if we can add additional feature to compare different databases and pick the avaerage data-point as our result. In line with the scope of my course, my prototype just allows you to go through one source and extract the best results of interest related to the climate of a place.


## Questions

### General Questions
<details>
<summary>Which package/library does the sample program demonstrate?</summary>
<p>

- I used the Tkinter standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) library for Python. It provides an object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. I did not have to download as it is included with most Python installations, and it's widely used for creating simple and effective GUI applications due to its ease of use and the availability of comprehensive documentation.
- I enjoyed the advantages of the libary including, but not limited to widget libary, window, and cross-platform advatages.

<summary>Where can I find the source code?</summary>
<p>

- Our project's source code is located in the main branch.

### Technical Questions
<details>
<summary>How does someone run your program?</summary>
<p>

- To set up the project locally, please follow the following setup instructions.
  1. Download the source code : weather.py along with all the image file ( ending with .png).
  2. Pre-install the 3 required libraries : geopy, timezoneFinder, pytz.
  3. Run the module and wait 1 minute before usage.
  4. Enter the city of interest in the search bar and click on the magnifier to get result.
  5. The results would be updated in less than a minute and the accuracy is dependent on the database used (in our case: openweatherapp).

<details>
<summary>What purpose does your program serve?</summary>
<p>

- Weather applications like the prototype here can serve multiple purposes, catering to different needs ranging from daily weather forecasts to specialized requirements for activities such as agriculture, aviation, and maritime operations. It is very hard to think of how airplanes will coordinate their speed and direction without adequate ATC (Air Traffic Control) input about the weather.
- It also serves a starting point to accumulate more data points and then average the desired result of interest.
- The ANSYS of the program depends on the databank used and supports future statistical research.

<details>
<summary>What would be some sample input/output?</summary>
<p>

- The system requirements for running this project would be to have pre-installed the required libraries (depends on the age and type of PC)
- Next, you could run my application and enter a city name like "Delhi" in the search bar.
- Hit the search bar and you would see the following with the updated results:

This project was a result of extensive research over the internet and youtube. I faced significant challenges in the last minute
to manage my certificate credentials in order to access the inner functional html calls. The best solution is to update your configurations internally in the terminal for the certificate. Do NOT edit your code as bypassing the control structures can lead to serious security implications.
